# ShopManager
ShopManager is a python program to help local shopkeepers. 
# About Program
This program is written in python language and also use csv files for storing of data. This is an all-in-one program, which can manage inventory, make bills, manage dues for shopkeeper.
This program can help those local shopkeepers who have to manage their inventories manually, make bills on paper which have a nice margin of error, also shopkeepers who have a shop of daily goods and people used to pay the monthly dues at once.
# Idea
I got the idea to make this program when I became a part of class discussion on how the shopkeepers have to manage their shops and difficulties they have to face.
From that moment I started collecting information from my nieghbourhood shops' shopkeepers, and various other sources and at last I compilled the problems and came up with these few most common problems.
Then I planned the objectives of my program and started my work i.e. coding it....
Finally I was successful in achieving all the decided objectives and boom, final product is out......
